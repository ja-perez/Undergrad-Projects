# ML-Adaboost
Author: Javier Perez
Purpose: CS 422 Project 3 - To gain a better understanding of the Adaboost algorithm and ensembles.
<h2> Description </h2>
Implementation of the Adaboost ML algorithm utilizing the Scikit
library for DecisionTree classifiers.

The adaboost.py file contains two functions, adaboost_train and adaboost_test.

# Training and Testing
As the names suggest, adaboost_train trains the algorithm using decision tree stumps, while
adaboost_test takes the finished model and calculates a weighted sum prediction on some
test dataset with the overall accuracy being returned.

A test script is included as per the project requirements.
